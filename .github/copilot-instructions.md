# Project Overview

## '177' Learners

This project is a modern web development course for a community college. The audience is primarily students who are new to web development. They have been exposed to HTML and CSS but have never done any real programming.

## '277' Learners

This course builds core client-side programming skills using JavaScript. Students will learn to manipulate the DOM, handle events, use control structures, and work with strings, objects, cookies, and browser storage. Emphasis is placed on writing interactive, efficient code and exploring advanced functions.

The course continues on into React and NextJS.

**Lesson Timing**: Design lessons to take approximately 2-3 hours total (including any pre-work reading). Consider the pace appropriate for community college students new to programming.

## JavaScript Coding Standards

**Variable Declarations & Modern JavaScript**:

- **Always use `const` instead of `let`**: Use `const` for all variable declarations unless reassignment is absolutely necessary
- **Use template literals**: Use backticks for string interpolation instead of concatenation
- **Strict equality**: Always use `===` instead of `==`

**Function Design (Educational Focus)**:

- **Single responsibility**: Each function should do one clear thing
- **Keep functions short**: Aim for functions under 15 lines (excluding comments)
- **Use descriptive names**: Function and variable names should be self-explanatory

**Code Clarity & Maintainability**:

- **Meaningful variable names**: Minimum 3 characters (except loop counters: i, j, k)
- **Avoid nested complexity**: Keep nesting levels shallow for readability

**Immutability & Best Practices**:

- **No parameter mutation**: Don't modify function parameters
- **Prefer immutable operations**: Use array methods like `map`, `filter` instead of loops when possible
- **Consistent returns**: Functions should always return a value or never return

## Wrap-Up & Assessment

- Key takeaways and recap of main points
- Hands-on assessment or real-world problem-solving task
- Detailed reflection document that demonstrates authentic understanding of the topic. Have the learner detail what 😕 them and what they found straightforward.
- Assessments need to reference checkpoint questions sprinkled throughout the lesson to ensure engagement and comprehension. We can even ask for screenshots of their work to ensure they did the hands-on parts. In some cases, even a short video walkthrough could be requested at critical steps.
