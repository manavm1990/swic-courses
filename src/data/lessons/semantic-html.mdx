## Introduction

- **Icebreaker:** Have you ever used a heading tag just to make text bigger? Or stacked a bunch of `<br>` tags to add space?
- **Real-world scenario:** Imagine a visually impaired user navigating your site with a screen reader. Semantic HTML makes their experience possible—and better for everyone.
- **Lesson objectives:**
  - Understand what semantic HTML is and why it matters
  - Identify common mistakes and how to avoid them
  - Practice writing clean, accessible HTML
- **Introduction to the concept:**
  - Semantic HTML uses tags that describe their meaning and role in the document (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`).
  - This helps browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies understand your content.

## Core Concept Overview

- **Key terms:** semantic, accessibility, landmark elements, structure
- **Analogy:** Think of semantic HTML as labeling rooms in a house—"kitchen," "bedroom," "bathroom"—so everyone knows what each space is for.
- **Common mistakes:**
  - Using headings for size, not structure (multiple `<h1>`, skipping levels)
  - Using `<br>` for spacing
  - Overusing `<div>` and `<span>` instead of semantic tags
  - Not using `<label>` for form fields
  - Missing `alt` on images
  - Using `<table>` for layout
  - Not using lists for list content
- **Conceptual quiz:**
  1. What is semantic HTML?
  2. Why is it important for accessibility?
  3. Which tag would you use for navigation links?
  4. What’s wrong with using `<br>` for spacing?
  5. Why should you avoid multiple `<h1>` tags?

## Hands-On Application

- **Step-by-step:**
  1. Refactor a block of HTML to use semantic tags
  2. Add missing `alt` attributes and labels
  3. Replace `<br>`-based spacing with CSS
- **Example:**
  ```html
  <!-- Bad -->
  <div>
    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br /><br />
    <div>We are awesome!</div>
  </div>
  <!-- Good -->
  <main>
    <header><h1>About Us</h1></header>
    <section><p>We are awesome!</p></section>
  </main>
  ```
- **Enhancement exercise:**
  - Take a page you’ve built before and make it as semantic as possible.

## Advanced Concepts & Comparisons

- **Deeper dive:**
  - Landmark elements: `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`
  - When to use `<section>` vs `<article>`
- **Comparison:**
  - Semantic vs non-semantic tags
- **Pros and cons:**
  - Semantic: accessible, SEO-friendly, maintainable
  - Non-semantic: quick, but confusing and inaccessible
- **Mini project:**
  - Build a simple blog layout using only semantic tags
- **Retrospective:**
  - How did semantic tags improve your code?

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- **Common challenges:**
  - Unsure which tag to use? Check [MDN’s HTML element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
  - Don’t use headings for size—use CSS!
  - Always use one `<h1>` per page
- **Best practices:**
  - Use semantic tags for structure
  - Use CSS for presentation
  - Test with a screen reader or accessibility tool
- **Enhancement:**
  - Try using ARIA roles only if you can’t use a semantic tag

## Wrap-Up & Assessment

- **Key takeaways:**
  - Semantic HTML is about meaning, not just appearance
  - It’s essential for accessibility and maintainability

- **Advanced quiz:**
  1. What’s the difference between `<section>` and `<article>`?
  2. Why is `<nav>` important?
  3. How does semantic HTML help SEO?
  4. What’s wrong with using `<table>` for layout?
  5. How do you make a form accessible?
  6. What’s the role of `<main>`?
  7. Why avoid multiple `<h1>` tags?
  8. When should you use `<aside>`?
  9. What’s the best way to add space between elements?
  10. How do you label a button for screen readers?

  For the quiz, provide answers and explanations after the questions, with adequate reflection in well-formatted MD. How much of this information ℹ️ was new to you? How well did the pre-req course prepare you for this?

  What did you learn from the video and/or is there anything that you found and explored on Mozilla's Developer Network (MDN) that you found particularly helpful?

- **Hands-on assessment / Homework:**
  - Create any web page you like (a personal homepage, a favorite recipe, a blog post, etc.) using only semantic HTML. **Do not add any styles yet!** Focus on using the correct tags for structure and meaning.
  - Just use GitHub Gist for this. You can even copy/paste some stuff that you have already done, but make sure to update it to be semantic, using various tags that we have discussed in this lesson.
  - Share your Gist link in our class Teams channel.
